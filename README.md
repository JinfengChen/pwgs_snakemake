# pwgs_snakemake
Snakemake pipeline for running PhyloWGS on NIH Biowulf Cluster
Uses https://github.com/morrislab/phylowgs
This pipeline is a very rough pipeline, but it does have a couple of features which might be useful, including a tree parser
which PWGS doesn't include in their software. 

Importantly you should be able to get everything set up by editing just the config file and the samples.csv.
